          <h3>Basic Terminology</h3>
          <dl>
          <dt>What is a brokerage account?</dt>
          <dd>A special bank account that allows you to purchase stocks, bonds, and ETFs.</dd>
          
          <dt>What is a stock?</dt>
          <dd>Partial ownership of a company. You make money from stocks by dividends and selling them at a higher price than what you bought them for.</dd>
          
          <dt>What is a dividend?</dt>
          <dd>It’s a payment made to you as a reward for owning and holding on to a stock. It looks very similar to an interest payment; not all companies offer one.</dd>
          
          <dt>What is a bond?</dt>
          <dd>A form of debt that a company or city issues; it’s a way companies build new warehouses or cities build new schools. You make money from bonds from interest paid to you (because you are lending them money).</dd>
          
          <dt>What is an ETF?</dt>
          <dd>An ETF is a collection of stocks and bonds.</dd>
          
          <dt>Why should you buy ETFs (index funds)?</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Instead of buying $100 of Amazon, you can buy $100 of a collection of the top companies in the USA. These collections are called indexes.</p> 
        
            <p>If you own a little store and you want to sell soda cans to people, buying one big pack of Coca Cola may be a little risky. What happens if people start liking other drinks more? What happens if people like one brand this week, but not next? A safer choice would be to buy a variety pack that includes all of the most popular drinks for the same price.</p>
          
            <p>If you buy an ETF, you are doing the same thing. By investing in an index of many companies, you minimize your risk through diversification.</p>
          
            <p>This approach is statistically considered the safest way to invest, and it's often how your 401K money is invested.</p>
          
            <p>So let’s talk about <a href="retirement.html"> retirement investing</a>...</p>
