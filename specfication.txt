Project 1
Due TBD (Check on Canvas)

Purpose: In this project you are going to create the HTML and CSS for a website.

Requirements: Your project will partly consist of 5 main files: 4 HTML documents
and 1 CSS document. You will also have other files for your media. 

The CSS file should contain
the main style and formatting of the project. 

For this project no use of libraries or automated CSS code-generation will be allowed. 

I want you to come up with the structure of your site and
write the HTML and CSS that you feel fits that style. Review lecture slides and the past hw’s for
sample code but make sure to make it your own.

The purpose of this project is to create a personal site about one of your interests. Examples
include but are not limited to: favorite movie, show, book, artist, band, genre, sport, team,
person, place to visit, etc. Be as creative as you wish. If you have other ideas for your site we
can further discuss in class.

Review lecture material and make proper use of the elements, properties, and CSS covered. All
elements and attributes are available for you to use.

What I will be grading on:
● Submit your Github repo link on Canvas
● HTML and CSS has proper formatting and comments where appropriate
● Web page renders properly in Chrome
● Web page contains all required content, visually organized and styled according to best
practices.
● CSS rules and HTML tags/attributes abide by specifications given in lectures.
● Review the MDN reference site for 3 elements and 3 attributes not covered in class.
● Find a practical use for them on your website. Add comments describing where they are,
what they are, and how you are using them.
● Each student will list their 3 unique elements and 3 unique attributes on canvas. No
duplicates on the list between students. First come first served.
